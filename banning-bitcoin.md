17:12
basically
17:13
the biggest welfare queens on this
17:15
planet where
17:17
two thousand dollar suits and uh work on
17:20
wall street
17:21
do you think there's any chance of
17:24
i mean i see especially the us
17:25
government trying to
17:27
either a ban bitcoin
17:31
or b try to create their own bitcoin and
17:34
make bitcoin like illegal or something
17:39
um every government on the planet is
17:41
going to try and do both of those things
17:43
um to some extent or other some will do
17:46
it in a very
17:47
ham-fisted um and short-sighted way
17:53
they'll try to go for an outright ban of
17:56
course
17:56
the problem they face is this there is
17:59
no
18:00
place in which bitcoin exists it exists
18:02
everywhere on every computer that ever
18:04
has participated in the bitcoin system
18:06
so who exactly do you go after it's not
18:08
owned or controlled by any corporation
18:10
or individual
18:12
there is no center to it it's a
18:13
decentralized thing it's like saying
18:15
let's ban the web okay which part of it
18:17
all of it at the same time how um
18:21
and ultimately what bitcoin does at its
18:23
very fundamental
18:25
um basis is it uses mathematics
18:28
to secure the distribution of money as
18:31
communication
18:33
which means that as long as you can
18:34
express transactions
18:36
money in any communication medium
18:39
you can transmit it i can take a bitcoin
18:42
transaction
18:43
i can convert it into emoji i can post
18:47
it on twitter
18:48
and i've just transmitted a transaction
18:50
how do you know it's a transaction you
18:51
don't it just looks like a bunch of
18:53
emoji
18:53
my recipient does they'll make sure to
18:56
get that to the right place so that it
18:57
works the transaction
18:59
i can take a transaction i can embed it
19:01
in the color variations of a photo of
19:03
six kittens
19:05
and post that on a craigslist ad
19:08
now the other person can take so bottom
19:11
line
19:11
money is communication how do you ban
19:14
money when money is communication well
19:15
the only way you can do that is by
19:17
either
19:17
banning all communication which is
19:19
impossible um or
19:21
imposing enormously strict uh penalties
19:25
or fines to people who dare touch this
19:28
system
19:28
of money and then you run into some
19:31
other problems
19:32
in countries where the rule of law
19:33
matters banning
19:35
private individuals from engaging in
19:37
legitimate commercial transactions for
19:39
legal purposes
19:40
kind of doesn't make sense and if you
19:42
try to do it you're going to get a lot
19:43
of pushback and have to justify why
19:45
you're doing it
19:46
in places where the rule of law doesn't
19:48
matter you can do that in a very
19:50
ham-fisted approach and then everybody
19:52
up and down the line is going to ignore
19:53
you
19:54
get bribed probably in bitcoin turn a
19:57
blind eye
19:57
and the game continues because
19:59
governments have never effectively
20:00
banned
20:01
anything really they
20:04
try but saying it in the law and
20:08
actually making it happen on the ground
20:10
two different things especially when
20:11
what you're talking about
20:13
is for many people the difference
20:15
between feeding their family next month
20:17
or not
20:18
how much risk are they willing to take
20:20
um
20:21
and so you get into this weird situation
20:25
where what you're really talking about
20:26
is banning
20:28
legitimate commercial interactions
20:31
between voluntary
20:33
consenting adults in open markets
20:36
you can't really do that in democratic
20:38
countries without cracking down on
20:41
everything so more likely
20:44
sophisticated governments are going to
20:46
try indirect approaches
20:48
um the first and obvious one is
20:51
propaganda
